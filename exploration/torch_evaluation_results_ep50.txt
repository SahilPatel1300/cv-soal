2. CLASSIFICATION METRICS (at threshold=0.5)
===============================================
True Positives: 1848 - (Correct positive predictions)
True Negatives: 2424 - (Correct negative predictions)
False Positives: 536 - (Type I error; predicted positive but actually negative)
False Negatives: 192 - (Type II error; predicted negative but actually positive)

>> Standard Classification Metrics <<
Accuracy: 0.8544 - (Proportion of correct predictions)
Precision: 0.7752 - (TP/(TP+FP); proportion of positive predictions that are correct)
Recall/Sensitivity: 0.9059 - (TP/(TP+FN); proportion of actual positives correctly identified)
Specificity: 0.8189 - (TN/(TN+FP); proportion of actual negatives correctly identified)
F1 Score: 0.8354 - (Harmonic mean of precision and recall)
Balanced Accuracy: 0.8624 - (Average of recall and specificity)

===============================================
3. THRESHOLD OPTIMIZATION

===============================================
4. RANKING & DISCRIMINATION METRICS
===============================================
ROC AUC: 0.9254 - (Area under ROC curve; probability that a random positive is ranked higher than a random negative)
PR AUC (Average Precision): 0.8602 - (Area under precision-recall curve; summary of precision at different recall levels)
Log Loss: 0.3444 - (Cross-entropy loss; lower is better)
