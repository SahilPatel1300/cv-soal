2. CLASSIFICATION METRICS (at threshold=0.5)
===============================================
True Positives: 3822 - (Correct positive predictions)
True Negatives: 582 - (Correct negative predictions)
False Positives: 154 - (Type I error; predicted positive but actually negative)
False Negatives: 442 - (Type II error; predicted negative but actually positive)

>> Standard Classification Metrics <<
Accuracy: 0.8808 - (Proportion of correct predictions)
Precision: 0.9613 - (TP/(TP+FP); proportion of positive predictions that are correct)
Recall/Sensitivity: 0.8963 - (TP/(TP+FN); proportion of actual positives correctly identified)
Specificity: 0.7908 - (TN/(TN+FP); proportion of actual negatives correctly identified)
F1 Score: 0.9277 - (Harmonic mean of precision and recall)
Balanced Accuracy: 0.8436 - (Average of recall and specificity)

===============================================
3. THRESHOLD OPTIMIZATION
===============================================
Optimal threshold (maximizing F1): 0.1957

===============================================
4. RANKING & DISCRIMINATION METRICS
===============================================
ROC AUC: 0.9025 - (Area under ROC curve; probability that a random positive is ranked higher than a random negative)
PR AUC (Average Precision): 0.9750 - (Area under precision-recall curve; summary of precision at different recall levels)
Log Loss: 0.4478 - (Cross-entropy loss; lower is better)
