# Dex-Net 2.1 Dataset Analysis

This document explains the statistics generated by the Dex-Net 2.1 dataset analysis script.

## Grasp Quality Metrics

- **Mean metric value**: Average value of the grasp quality metric across all samples
- **Median metric value**: Middle value of the grasp quality metric when all values are sorted
- **Min/Max metric value**: Minimum and maximum values of the grasp quality metric
- **Standard deviation**: Measure of how spread out the grasp quality metric values are

## Grasp Quality Percentiles

Shows how the grasp quality metric is distributed across different percentiles (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th, 99th). Helps understand the distribution shape.

## Label Distribution

- **Positive samples**: Number and percentage of grasps with quality > 0.002 (considered successful)
- **Negative samples**: Number and percentage of grasps with quality â‰¤ 0.002 (considered unsuccessful)

## Binary Classification Metrics

- **True Positives (TP)**: Grasps correctly classified as successful
- **True Negatives (TN)**: Grasps correctly classified as unsuccessful
- **False Positives (FP)**: Grasps incorrectly classified as successful
- **False Negatives (FN)**: Grasps incorrectly classified as unsuccessful
- **Precision**: Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to total predicted positives (TP/(TP+FP))
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives (TP/(TP+FN))
- **Specificity**: Ratio of correctly predicted negative observations to all actual negatives (TN/(TN+FP))
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall (2*(Precision*Recall)/(Precision+Recall))
- **Accuracy**: Ratio of correctly predicted observations to total observations ((TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN))

## Grasp Parameters Statistics

### Depth Distribution (meters)
Statistics about the depth of grasps from the camera

### Axis Angle Distribution (radians)
Statistics about the angle of the grasp axis from the image x-axis

### Approach Angle Distribution (radians)
Statistics about the angle of the grasp approach relative to the camera optical axis

### Width Distribution (pixels)
Statistics about the width of the gripper projected into the depth image

## Correlation Analysis

Pearson correlation coefficients between grasp parameters and quality:
- **Depth vs. Quality**: How depth correlates with grasp quality
- **Axis Angle vs. Quality**: How grasp angle correlates with quality
- **Approach Angle vs. Quality**: How approach angle correlates with quality
- **Width vs. Quality**: How gripper width correlates with quality

## ROC and AUC Metrics

- **ROC AUC**: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes

## Threshold Analysis

Shows how different quality thresholds (instead of the standard 0.002) affect precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.
