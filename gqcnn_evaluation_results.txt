>> Standard Classification Metrics <<
Accuracy: 0.7990 - (Proportion of correct predictions)
Precision: 0.9050 - (TP/(TP+FP); proportion of positive predictions that are correct)
Recall/Sensitivity: 0.5806 - (TP/(TP+FN); proportion of actual positives correctly identified)
Specificity: 0.9561 - (TN/(TN+FP); proportion of actual negatives correctly identified)
F1 Score: 0.7074 - (Harmonic mean of precision and recall)
Balanced Accuracy: 0.7684 - (Average of recall and specificity)
Matthews Correlation Coefficient: 0.5975 - (Correlation between actual and predicted; -1 to 1)
